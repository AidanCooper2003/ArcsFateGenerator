1,DF03,Soothsayer,03,@[DefaultBooklet],Mana Siphons,Law,"Mana siphon tokens are placed in between planets with irregular borders. They do not count as being in a system. Anyone who controls both planets adjacent to the mana siphon token controls it. Any player who controls the mana siphon may in their prelude, if they aren't playing the lead card, as a bonus action either tax a city like it is loyal or build a ship at a starport like it is loyal, as long as that building is adjacent to that mana siphon."
